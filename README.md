Excited to share that I’ve successfully built a simple yet powerful Video Player App using modern Android development tools and architecture components.

🔧 Tech Stack Highlights:

🎥 ExoPlayer: For smooth and efficient media playback.

🧠 ViewModel: To manage UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.

💉 Dagger Hilt: For seamless dependency injection and cleaner code architecture.

🎮 Media Controls: Play, pause, seek functionality implemented for a better user experience.

🔍 This project helped me deepen my understanding of media playback, state management, and clean architecture in Android.

Always learning, always building. 💪
Open to feedback and collaboration!
